# hello-world
This is my first repository in which I would try to practice.

I have zero coding skills or background and currently, I don't know what I am doing.
But I know that this would be very beneficial for me in the coming years and decades.
If I fail and could not keep up, then at least, I tried to learn somehow.
If I succeed, then congratulations to me, I would be very proud of myself.
